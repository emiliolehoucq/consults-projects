Repo for *some* of the consults and projects I do at [Research Computing and Data Services](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/).

Most of the code that I write is not public or is hosted somewhere else (for example, I wrote the code in [this repo](https://github.com/counseloreducationdata)).
