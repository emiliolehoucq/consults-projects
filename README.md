Repo for some of the consults and projects I do at [Research Computing and Data Services](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/).

I also write code that's not public or code in other repos (for example, I wrote the code in [this repo](https://github.com/counseloreducationdata)).
