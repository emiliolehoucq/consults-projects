      "Thanks Daniel for your eloquent response to Michael. It is a breath of fresh air of hear the words of someone who is impacted at both levels and instead of expressing anger has found ways to work through the issues. I have a CACREP degree but it was a 48 hour community counseling degree and so to be Tricare eligible I too have to jump through hoops if I so choose. But I am an advocate for CACREP because we must move into the future. I do not now nor have I ever wanted to work in a psychology program because that is not who I am. I am a professional counselor and a counselor educator and not a psychologist. The idea that we are any because we want to teach in psychology is false on its face. I too am an active practitioner and have been for over 20 years. I do not teach from books I teach like so many of my colleagues from experience. I would challenge Michael and others who do not know our profession to learn about us before making statements that lack validity.\n",
      "We are a unique profession and no matter who it is from APA we do not need them to tell us who can teach in our programs and profession. We can and are doing that ourselves. Who teaches in counseling psychology programs is up to them.\n",

      "Response to Michael Reeder\n",
      "Honestly, I don't think that counselor educators are angry that we can't teach in psychology programs. I'm not. And I don't think it's fair for you to suggest that we aren't taking your point of view because we are educators rather than clinicians.\n",
      "I am a counselor educator (as previously disclosed, not from a CACREP program). I am also a clinician. Until a couple of years ago, I practiced as an at least 1/2 time clinician. I have worked in hospice, a psychiatric practice, and in private practice (with psychologists and other counselors). About five years ago, my partner and I established our own clinic (http://www.senecacps.com/). Although I'm no longer practicing there, I still own and oversee the clinic. Finally, for the past 2 1/2 years, I have been a professor of psychology and chair of the Department of Psychology at Aquinas College. I have just launched a new MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program<https://www.aquinas.edu/master-art-counseling> and intend to seek CACREP for this program as soon as we are allowed to do so. I offer this brief 'bio' to frame my response to your comments.\n",
      "First, as previously noted, Counselor Eds are not angry that we can't be part of psychology; rather, many of us are deeply offended that psychology and many of its members maintain double standards (i.e., you counselors NEED us in your house and you should never close the door on us, but we don't need you or want you in our house). I have had wonderful working relationships (both clinically and academically) with colleagues in psychology. I've also been attacked professionally by psychologists. Some years ago, a psychologist in a case in which I was forensic evaluator and an expert witness testified in court that I was violating the law by posing as a psychologist and practicing illegally by providing psychological testing. This turned the whole case upside down, and I was forced to copy the relevant portions of our licensure law to the judge and lawyers in this case to show that I was practicing legally and not presenting as a psychologist. This psychologist went on to file a complaint with the Ohio counselor board (which I invited him to do since his threat to turn me into the psychology board would be meaningless -- you know, since I'm not a psychologist). When the executive director of the board explained to the psychologist that I was not in violation of the law, the psychologist refused to accept this because \"we own testing.\" Arrogance and ignorance make an interesting mix.\n",
      "Second, as a clinician, and small business owner, I have had to deal first hand with the CACREP only movement in Ohio. Ohio adopted the CACREP only model several years ago. So, guess what? The fact that I do not have a CACREP degree in counseling has had no meaningful effect on my licence or my ability to practice. I still have my license and as long as I maintain it, I'll never lose it because of my lack of CACREP education. Yes, it's true that I personally am not eligible to provide Tricare services. So what -- there's a crapload of work to be done, and I never had a shortage of work. Sure, I wish it was different but I understand that the federal government had regulations etc. I hired a CACREP grad and she can do the Tricare.\n",
      "The sky has not fallen, and as a clinician/clinic owner, I'm not worried.\n",
      "As a counselor educator, I have been shut out of a couple of job prospects because they were specifically restricting their search to CACREP grads. Frustrating? Sure. But there are plenty of opportunities that don't require this. I'm sure this will shrink over time, but CACREP grads will be increasingly replacing older farts like me. It's called progress.\n",
      "There is still a place in the field for those of us who came into the field under the old rules. We have a lot to offer and will not be run out of town by mobs with pitchforks.\n",
      "We are working gradually to increase the standards of training and licensure in an effort to give the field of professional counseling greater recognizability and credibility. As a member of the field, I have been working on these issues for most of my career because when I came into the field in the mid 1990s, I found that people didn't get who I was as a professional. Say you're a psychologist, and everyone (thinks they) know what that means. Say you're a professional counselor, and you will have to have a discussion to educate people about what this means. Our efforts to evolve the field are about helping the members of the field realize the same kind of recognizability and credibility that their colleagues from other disciplines enjoy. That's all. It's not an evil plot. It's not about hurting anyone. It's about improving recognizability and credibility so that we may better serve clients and so that all potential clients can access a professional counselor when they need one.\n",

      "Hello All - just my 2 cents. Below, Christina stated:\n",
      "I agree and appreciate your perspective, Richard. It seems interesting to me that APA has now decided who they have deemed appropriate to teach our students.\n",
      "In my opinion, until we stop thinking of students as \"our\" students and \"their\" students we will never have a mutually beneficial resolution to this issue. The same goes for clients in the field. Everyone wants a \"piece of the pie.\" Once we realize that clients are not \"pie\" (or insert some other analogy here) we will all be able to work together for the benefit of those we serve. Each of our professions (counseling, social work, psychology, MFts) bring unique skills to the table. If we were to work together with other helping professions we could insure that clients would get to the right place to meet their needs. Same goes for students - if we work together as professions we can make sure students get to the right training programs to meet their career goals.\n",
      "My guess is that this will be an unpopular opinion. But, it is one that I felt the need to throw out given the nature of the discussion and the comments about our friends (or potential friends) in psychology. As counselors we are all about inclusion and collaboration. Why does our philosophy differ when it comes to this issue? I work closely with psychologists and social workers in my community all the time - as I am sure many of you do. So, why throw our values out the window now when someone else offers up their contrasting thoughts on the idea of professional identity?\n",

Once again they intrude into our profession and seek to decide what we do. Remember that consistently APA, NASW and many of those other organizations have consistently worked against counselor licensure and when that did not work they worked to restrict our practice and now that we are making gains in all fronts they want to come in and determine who should train the members of our profession. Notice thought that they did not support the training of their own master’s students for eventual licensure.\n",

      "Building Support for the Inclusion of Psychologists and Other Professions in the Continued Training of a Diverse Workforce\n",
      "On Sunday 10/11/15 the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 29 (Society for the Advancement of Psychotherapy) unanimously passed a resolution, joined by Division 17 (Society of Counseling Psychology), in order to:\n",
      "• Fully support the role of psychologists, counselors, MFTs, psychiatrists, social workers, and other professionals in the training of master’s level counselors, and\n",
      "• To NOT support any efforts that “limit core faculty or supervisors to only those from one designated training/professional background”.\n",
      "Conversations with persons knowledgeable with the vote indicate that Divisions 17 and 29 may be looking to create greater support within the APA as a whole for master’s level practitioners. State counseling boards that are looking at adopting more narrow rigid program accreditation requirements in licensing (like CACREP) may want to reconsider given the increasing support from within APA divisions and elsewhere that are promoting quality accreditation and licensing standards with less rigid requirements.\n",
      "The clear and public voicing of resolution by these two APA divisions joins the groundswell of support for a more inclusive and just solution to training accreditation, licensing, and insurance/government paneling of practitioners. ACA division Counselors for Social Justice (CSJ) and some state AMHCA chapters have previously come out in favor of solutions that allow all competently trained counselors equal status in the workplace. A new national association is expected to be announced in the next few weeks which will concentrate on this matter.\n",
      "It is anticipated that efforts to develop methods, institutions, associations, or financial means to advocate on behalf of all counselors will receive a boost from the public support of these two APA divisions. Currently APA, as an organizational whole, maintains its position of not being involved in master’s level training or licensing. The growing pressure from APA divisions may impact this position in the future.\n",
      "This resolution is GOOD NEWS for master’s level non-CACREP counselors, and particularly students and staff involved with master’s level counseling psychology training programs, in their efforts to promote high quality and inclusive accreditation requirements.\n",
      "The announcement in its entirely follows below. While not involved in this announcement, Dr. Jesse Owen (original submitter of this resolution) when contacted indicated a desire to be available for questions at Jesse.Owens@du.edu<mailto:Jesse.Owens@du.edu> .\n",

      "Keep in mind that the 16PF (sixteen personality factor questionnaire) is a clinically designed instrument utilized in mental health environments based on the work of Cattell and includes norms, ranges of pathology and help with potential treatment recommendations. It is however not a measure of interpersonal dynamics. The Myers-Briggs is not a clinical assessment, is a great tool for group dynamics but not really designed for families. It also has no norms or statistical validity so it will not be useful as a measure of progress or decrease in area of concern.\n",

Thousands of homes have been impacted by the worst flooding in decades. Almost 2 weeks out there are still people who are in American Red Cross shelters who cannot return to their homes. Although the national media has largely stopped covering this disaster, the Red Cross is there coordinating a robust response to serve the residents of the nearly 25 impacted counties. The Red Cross needs more DMH responders to ensure the emotional needs of clients are met. Interested volunteers should be Red Cross trained (i.e., have taken the Disaster Mental Health Fundamental Course)AND be part of the Volunteer Connection system. Please note the expected deployment length is 10 days. If you are available to deploy and are Red Cross trained, please update your information and availability in the Red Cross Volunteer Connection and/or contact your local chapter about deployment.

      "Subject: The Counseling Profession & APA\n",
      "Hello Colleagues,\n",
      "As we each weigh in with our perception of what the resolution offered by APA Divisions 17 & 29 really means, I want to be sure we don't lose sight of the broader context. Over the weekend there was a suggestion that we should accept the \"olive branch\" offered by this resolution. I cannot imagine how this can be seen as an olive branch, but if you read the post closely, psychologists are described as offering peace and healing, cross fertilization, and seeking to enrich both professions. Those who disagree with their position are \"beating war drums\" and casting aspersions over a \"petty turf war\". Curiously violent language again, and clearly biased.\n",
      "The issues that we are dealing with here are neither petty nor are they distant history. The psychology profession has opposed counseling licensure from Virginia in 1976 to California in 2009. There are some atrocious examples historically of counselors being arrested or sued for purportedly practicing psychology without a license. A CESNet poster over the weekend noted how he personally was accused by a psychologist of practicing outside his scope of practice, despite practice rights provided by the law. We have heard recently about psychologists in Kentucky currently challenging counselors' ability to conduct mental health evaluations. Counselors faced that same issue in Ohio and Indiana in the late 1990s. In Louisiana in 2005, counselors had to have legislation passed to protect their right to provide a diagnosis for their clients because the psychology profession challenged their ability to do so. Counselors' ability to do their job is not a petty issue, and the hostility towards licensed counselors by psychology has been persistent, and is current.\n",
      "Psychologists are appropriately concerned with protecting their title and not allowing individuals to practice psychology without a license. But many of the actions the psychology profession has taken against counselors have gone far beyond protecting their title. Counselors are now undertaking steps to ensure that individuals who are licensed as counselors are actually prepared as counselors. That is why we counselors must think in terms of \"our students\". We have finally established a license in all 50 states, despite opposition from psychologists, and psychologists want to capitalize on the work that we have done. It is a remarkable position to argue, \"We oppose you having a counseling license at all, but we insist you include our graduates in it\". Protecting our title means being sure that counselors are prepared as counselors, and the profession has decided to do that through accreditation, as has every other mental health profession.\n",
      "Having said all of that, I know several of the psychologists who have engaged in this discussion on CESnet and elsewhere, and I hold no ill will towards them individually or professionally. Certainly there are individual psychologists who choose to embrace the professional identity of a counselor and are well-equipped to train counselors. But that appears to be an ever-shrinking group of individuals within the psychology profession. And this resolution doesn't suggest that \"some psychologists\" or even counseling psychologists should be considered eligible to train counselors (a position I still would not agree with). This resolution states that all psychologists by definition are competent to train anybody in any of the mental health professions.\n",
      "I am not angry about not being allowed to teach in counseling psychology programs because I have no desire to teach in counseling psychology programs. My training and preparation is that of a counselor. My license and my professional identity is that of a counselor, which is why I am a counselor educator. My frustration is with the psychology profession, which has been so consistently hostile towards the counseling profession, but now wants graduates of their programs to be licensed with the very credentials that they have opposed. If we are all one profession then APA should have been speaking directly to state psychology boards and psychological associations, to tell them that their opposition to the counseling license was counter to our collective benefit. But they didn't. APA would have told their state boards and associations that counselors have the right to conduct mental health testing, a right that is included in state laws and regulations. But they didn't. APA would have told their state boards and associations that counselors have the right to diagnose clients, a right that is included in state laws and regulations. But they didn't. Those would have been actual olive branches. That would have been a demonstration that the psychology profession respects the counseling profession and the work the counselors do. We have never seen that.\n",

      "Hello all,\n",
      "I really appreciate the additional comments. It is good to hear from folks who have different perspectives. Just a couple comments that might help (or not):\n",
      " 1. We are now up to 4 divisions within APA that endorse this resolution – the original authored division Society for the Advancement of Psychotherapy (Div 29), Counseling Psychology (Div 17), Society for Family Psychology (Div 43), and Division of Group Psychotherapy and Group Psychology (Div 49). The resolution is also being entertained by several other divisions.\n",
      " 2. The reason I started this resolution at the Division level (vs. the upper levels ie.., Board of Directors/Council) is a philosophical belief that more voices should be heard and represented in the governance of our organizations. This more grass-roots effort can take more time for important work to get done, but I hope that it will also engage more folks in the conversation to raise awareness and challenge assumptions. I have seen this happen within some of the divisions of APA, which gives me hope.\n",
      " 3. Lastly, my intent was to not direct how ACA or CACREP informs the training of counselors. Rather, there are many folks within APA that train counselors and other accrediting bodies for counselors (e.g., MCAC). If ACA and CACREP would like to define who can and can’t train counselors that is well within their right. I likely have 30 years of a career left, it is my hope to have more unity among the major mental health organizations by the time I retire…we all have major work to do collectively to help the lives of those who are in pain and suffering.\n",

      "When I read the posts of Drs. Owen and Mobley, two APA leaders, I do not detect the arrogance or condescension in their ideas that many writers on CESNET have accused APA of as result of their resolution. I hear two sincere scholars who want to bring a diverse faculty to the training of counselors. What I read in Dr. Owen's post, who was the author the APA resolution, is advocacy on behalf of counselor educators within APA to give them the undisputed right to teach in counseling psychology programs. I think this is a very generous offer of peace and healing between our two national organizations. Cross fertilization of ideas and scholars across APA and ACA will enrich both professions. The current exclusion of masters students in counseling psychology from the profession of counseling is an act of retribution against APA for wrongs these students are not responsible for.\n",
      "To me the most striking part about the APA resolution is that an outside organization called us on our discrimination against our own ACA members, both practitioners and faculty, that we could not see ourselves. Whatever APA's own failings, we should accept the Olive Branch they are extending to us, end the petty turf war between us, and work in unison to better both professions.\n",
      "Those who beat the war drums of inter-professional conflict and cast aspersions on other professions for holding the same imperfections that we do as counselors, would do better to ask how we can mend fences, collaborate, and work together for the higher goals both we and psychology share. If these counseling leaders invested their energy in reconciling with APA instead of alienating them, we would all be the better for it. An eye for an eye, as Gandhi said, will just leave us all blind.\n",
      "I wish the Presidents of ACA and APA would meet to find a way for counselors and counseling psychologists to work together as kindred spirits and end both the CACREP only and APA only exclusions.\n",

      "Oh for Pete’s sake…\n",
      "“This writer” said specifically, “Certainly there are individual psychologists who choose to embrace the professional identity of a counselor and are well-equipped to train counselors.” AND, “I know some wonderful individuals who are psychologists and maybe they struggle with how their profession has been acting towards counselors.” How is that painting a profession with one brush?\n",
      "I’m not sure what movement you are referring to when you say, “the founder of our movement” but anyone who wants to be taken seriously in this discussion must stop saying Carl Rogers founded counseling. Rogers was a great guy, but for all of the good that he did for the counseling profession, Frank Parsons in the late 1800s, and Jesse Davis and Clifford Beers in the early 1900s were shaping the foundation of the counseling profession through prevention, educational interventions, and vocational counseling when Carl Rogers was in elementary school. That information is included in every single Introduction to Counseling textbook. And while we are on the topic of Rogers, let’s recall that Goodyear et al. (2008) found that only 2.7% of counseling psychologists who were members of the Society for Counseling Psychology (SCP; Division 17) endorsed person centered as their primary theoretical orientation, and the numbers were even lower (1.6%) for counseling psychologists who were not members of SCP. So if being Rogerian is the benchmark for who is a counselor (it should not be), somewhere in the neighborhood of 97% of counseling psychologists are not counselors.\n",
      "You are correct that counseling psychologists were training counselors before CACREP existed because that was before counselors were barred from sitting for the psychology license, sued, and arrested. CACREP was the response to the psychology profession making it abundantly clear that counselors are not psychologists. We agree.\n",
      "Jesse and I have been having a pretty nice exchange back channel, and I don’t have an issue with his motivation, despite how I feel about the resolution. But I stand by this assertion. If it was this easy today, for one psychologist of good conscience to start this discussion with one resolution, where was the entire profession of psychology over the last forty years? They were not starting resolutions saying let’s come together, they were trying to push counselors out of the market. Spin it however you’d like, but counselors are not the aggressors in this. Psychology started this problem and it is unreasonable to expect counselors to fix it.\n",

      "It is unfortunate that this writer is painting all psychologists with one brush, forgetting that the founder of our movement was the psychologist, Carl Rogers. It is further unfortunate that the efforts of two leaders in APA, who have ventured into the very hostile environment of CESNET, were dismissed for their truly sincere efforts to bridge an unnecessary divide between APA and ACA.\n",
      "It is true that all the mental health professions, including social workers and psychiatrists, have at some point fought the advancement of counseling. But Counseling Psychology is a separate branch of psychology that has distinguished itself by graduating a litany of ACA Presidents and Counseling leaders. In fact, Counseling Psychologists were training counselors before CACREP even existed.\n",
      "It would be unfair to conflate counseling psychology with the guild-ism of PhD Clinical Psychology that exists in many states. The two APA leaders who posted on CESNET are not against uniform counselor standards nor are they supporting the past abuses of APA. They are courageous enough to decry the professional discrimination of APA and are appealing to the larger organization that it end. However, they hold an equally valid vision of professional counseling - one that recognizes the confluence of counseling psychology and counselor education in building what we understand as professional counseling. Both parts are integral to the whole.\n",
      "If counseling psychologists did not care about counselor education, they would not have gone to the trouble of advocating for their resolution within their own contentious organization. To reject their olive branch, even with eloquent words and arguments, is what feels war-like to me.\n",

      "Hello Colleagues,\n",
      "As we each weigh in with our perception of what the resolution offered by APA Divisions 17 & 29 really means, I want to be sure we don’t lose sight of the broader context. Over the weekend there was a suggestion that we should accept the “olive branch” offered by this resolution. I cannot imagine how this can be seen as an olive branch, but if you read the post closely, psychologists are described as offering peace and healing, cross fertilization, and seeking to enrich both professions. Those who disagree with their position are “beating war drums” and casting aspersions over a “petty turf war”. Curiously violent language again, and clearly biased.\n",
      "The issues that we are dealing with here are neither petty nor are they distant history. The psychology profession has opposed counseling licensure from Virginia in 1976 to California in 2009. There are some atrocious examples historically of counselors being arrested or sued for purportedly practicing psychology without a license. A CESNet poster over the weekend noted how he personally was accused by a psychologist of practicing outside his scope of practice, despite practice rights provided by the law. We have heard recently about psychologists in Kentucky currently challenging counselors’ ability to conduct mental health evaluations. Counselors faced that same issue in Ohio and Indiana in the late 1990s. In Louisiana in 2005, counselors had to have legislation passed to protect their right to provide a diagnosis for their clients because the psychology profession challenged their ability to do so. Counselors’ ability to do their job is not a petty issue, and the hostility towards licensed counselors by psychology has been persistent, and is current.\n",
      "Psychologists are appropriately concerned with protecting their title and not allowing individuals to practice psychology without a license. But many of the actions the psychology profession has taken against counselors have gone far beyond protecting their title. Counselors are now undertaking steps to ensure that individuals who are licensed as counselors are actually prepared as counselors. That is why we counselors must think in terms of “our students”. We have finally established a license in all 50 states, despite opposition from psychologists, and psychologists want to capitalize on the work that we have done. It is a remarkable position to argue, “We oppose you having a counseling license at all, but we insist you include our graduates in it”. Protecting our title means being sure that counselors are prepared as counselors, and the profession has decided to do that through accreditation, as has every other mental health profession.\n",
      "Having said all of that, I know several of the psychologists who have engaged in this discussion on CESnet and elsewhere, and I hold no ill will towards them individually or professionally. Certainly there are individual psychologists who choose to embrace the professional identity of a counselor and are well-equipped to train counselors. But that appears to be an ever-shrinking group of individuals within the psychology profession. And this resolution doesn't suggest that “some psychologists” or even counseling psychologists should be considered eligible to train counselors (a position I still would not agree with). This resolution states that all psychologists by definition are competent to train anybody in any of the mental health professions.\n",
      "I am not angry about not being allowed to teach in counseling psychology programs because I have no desire to teach in counseling psychology programs. My training and preparation is that of a counselor. My license and my professional identity is that of a counselor, which is why I am a counselor educator. My frustration is with the psychology profession, which has been so consistently hostile towards the counseling profession, but now wants graduates of their programs to be licensed with the very credentials that they have opposed. If we are all one profession then APA should have been speaking directly to state psychology boards and psychological associations, to tell them that their opposition to the counseling license was counter to our collective benefit. But they didn't. APA would have told their state boards and associations that counselors have the right to conduct mental health testing, a right that is included in state laws and regulations. But they didn't. APA would have told their state boards and associations that counselors have the right to diagnose clients, a right that is included in state laws and regulations. But they didn't. Those would have been actual olive branches. That would have been a demonstration that the psychology profession respects the counseling profession and the work the counselors do. We have never seen that.\n",
      "I know some wonderful individuals who are psychologists and maybe they struggle with how their profession has been acting towards counselors. If so, maybe they can also understand why counselors must take steps to protect and advance our profession.\n",

Thus we are posting this in order to help the ACA community understand the position of CSJ and clarify a number of misconceptions regarding our commitment to high quality standards, counselor identity, accreditation, licensure, portability, and the future of the counseling profession.\n",
      "It is an absolute core foundation of CSJ to acknowledge the past and present important role that American Counseling Association (ACA), CACREP, and CORE have historically played in the counseling profession and the advocacy for quality standards. The quality of the accredited programs contributes to maintaining high standards in meeting the needs of the millions upon millions of individuals who need counseling primarily in the United States but also globally.\n",
      "CSJ wants to acknowledge the important role that the American Counseling Association and its leaders have played in developing the counseling profession and its advocacy for professional counselors. We also recognize that some of our great leaders, including many ACA Presidents, counselor educators, and practitioners, have come from diverse professional backgrounds that include counseling psychologists and that many of the major contributors to our textbooks and theories have come from related disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, and social work. CSJ fully acknowledges and values the contributions of these colleagues to the counseling profession and recognizes that many of these colleagues have had long standing relationships and leadership positions within ACA.\n",
      "It should be noted that CSJ is NOT in opposition to ACA, CACREP, CORE, MCAC, or nonaffiliated programs. In fact we support and embrace them all and maintain our position of supporting all counselors who identify with ACA and the counseling profession regardless of training and experience with CACREP and non-affiliated CACREP programs. Our aim is to continue to work with all of the stakeholders in an effort to best serve the significant number of people who are marginalized in our society and in desperate need of mental health services in the U.S. and internationally. We support high quality counseling training standards which will lead to licensure and portability including support of the American Association of State Counseling Boards (AASCB) position on portability. CSJ, without question, believes in and supports the importance of counselor identity, ACA ethical standards, and high standards of educational training that will ensure counselors are trained with a counseling identity.\n",
      "In summary, CSJ has taken the position to support all counselors. We seek inclusion. We aspire for unity within the profession. Ultimately we believe that the need for counseling services and our duty to serve the vast number of people who need these services is paramount. We seek open discussion and resolution to the conflicts that exist currently in our profession and to find a way in which all highly trained counselors can move forward to serve those most in need. CSJ realizes that the counseling profession is in a time of highly polarized and passionately debated issues facing our profession. This can be a time for creative collaboration to strengthen the profession.\n",
      "Although the CSJ Board has clearly chosen NOT to engage in the charged and polarized debates via listservs we do want the CSJ and ACA community, our counselor colleagues, know of our position. We are committed to engage in open and honest discussion regarding these issues that are compassionate, thoughtful, and productive. In the future we anticipate continuing to sponsor ways to engage in solution focused dialogue as we did at the last ACA conference with our Town Hall meeting to discuss accreditation. If you have specific questions about our position please contact Judy Daniels directly at judydaniels@gmail.com<mailto:judydaniels@gmail.com> and she will respond to you individually or pass your inquiry on to one of our other board members for a response. We do not intend to respond or debate over this listserv and in general we advocate for respectful discussion, dialogue, agreement, and disagreement in working through these difficult issues facing the profession.\n",

      "My name is Jennifer Howard Leonce. I am a doctoral student working on a research study. I am working on a doctoral project titled “Exploring BIPOC Counselor Education and Supervision Faculty and Doctoral Students Experiences with Racial Microaggressions in Academia.” My research will be overseen by my faculty mentor, Dr. Megan Mahon.\n",
      "The research aims to examine the experiences of BIPOC Counselor Education and Supervision faculty and doctoral students who have had experiences with microaggressions. It is hoped that this study will contribute to developing an understanding of the barriers to success experienced by BIPOC Counselor Education and Supervision faculty and doctoral students. I will recruit BIPOC Counselor Education and Supervision faculty and doctoral students to participate in my study. I want to conduct my research online.\n",
      " * Participation in this study will include one 45-60 minute interview via phone or Zoom. A follow-up email will take place, and a review draft of the research findings will be provided for feedback. You may waive your opportunity to review the draft.\n",
      "Participants will be screened using an electronic survey to determine if they meet the following criteria:\n",
      "• self-identify as BIPOC (Black, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaskan Native, Desi, Asian, Pacific Islander, Chicanx, or Latinx) descent.\n",
      " • earned a Ph.D., Ed.D., Psy.D. in Counselor Education or closely related fields or currently in a doctoral program\n",

      "The exclusion criteria are:\n",
      "• involved in legal action against the university.\n",
      "I would also greatly appreciate it if you would forward this request to other counselors and students eligible to participate.\n",
      "I have obtained approval from Capella University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). A copy of the final letter from the Capella University IRB will be provided to you before any research activities begin.\n",
      "My projected start date is May 2023, and I expect this study will last six months to one year.\n",
      "I am responsible for the preservation of the privacy of research participants. I will not name the research participants when I write my doctoral paper. I will not describe the participants in such a way that they will be identifiable. I will work to preserve site anonymity when I write my paper. However, I cannot guarantee that the site will remain unknown.\n",
